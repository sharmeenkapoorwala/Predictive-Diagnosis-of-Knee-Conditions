Description: 
Osteoporosis is the leading pathological disorder of bones after arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is done by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). To make a detection system that is accepted worldwide and used as an alternative pre-screening tool, there is a need to make a research data center, which implies researchers from different areas of research and different countries should work on particular datasets and find a common solution. Inspired by this scenario, they have presented the database for the detection of osteoporosis in this article. The database consists of clinical factors that are responsible for osteoporosis, with the T-score values obtained from the Quantitative Ultrasound System and Knee X-ray for each participant. The main objective of this dataset is to make the research of finding the cost-effective, timely, and accurate osteoporotic detection system data-centric. 
Osteoporosis Knee X-ray database, which comprises three subfolders: Normal, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis, and MS-Excel sheet of 240 subjects (observations). There are 27 variables in the Excel sheet. The nomenclature of “patient details” includes the following information:
BMDlevel-SubjectID: For example, the image file “OS1” represents the details of an Osteoporosis participant with ID of 1, “OP1” represents the details of an Osteopenia participant with ID of 1, and “N1” represents the details of a normal participant with ID of 1. (3 types of diagnosis: Normal, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis). The BMD level and IDs of participants in “Subfolders” and “Ms-excel sheet” represent the same sample.
Categorical Variables:

Patient ID
Joint Pain
Gender
Smoker
Alcoholic
Diabetic 
Hypothyroidism
Seizure Disorder
Estrogen Use
Occupation
History of Fracture
Dialysis
Family history of Osteoporosis
Daily Eating Habits
Medical History
Site
Obesity
Diagnosis 


Quantitative Variables:
Age
Menopause Age
Height (meter)
Weight (KG)
Number of Pregnancies
Maximum Walking Distance (km)
T-score value
Z-score value
BMI

There are lot of variables mentioned in the dataset, but we are going to focus on Gender, Age, Joint Pain, Smoker, Occupation, Family History of Osteoporosis, Obesity, Number of Pregnancies, BMI, T-Score Value, Z-score Value. We will check the effect of age, BMI, obesity on diagnosis.
