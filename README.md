# Predictive-Diagnosis-of-Knee-Conditions
Osteoporosis is the leading pathological disorder of bones after arthritis, affecting millions of
people worldwide. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is done by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiome
try (DEXA).Inspired by this scenario, we have selected this database for the detection of
osteoporosis. The database consists of clinical factors that are responsible for osteoporosis,
with the T-score values obtained from the Quantitative Ultrasound System and Knee X-ray
for each participant. The research question for our project is “Can we predict if a patient
has a normal or abnormal knee diagnosis (osteopenia or osteoporosis) based on
basic patient data?” and the goal of our data analysis and statistical modeling is to create
a predictive model which is cost effective, can assist with early detection so it can help the
doctors use prevention strategies (like diet changes, medications, or exercise programs) before
major issues develop and last but not the least factor is it will be a support for Automated
Systems i.e. it can be a first step towards AI-driven diagnostic tools that could eventually
assist radiologists or orthopedic specialists.The analysis includes data wrangling, analyzing
patterns and corelations and eventually applying statistical modeling or machine learing to
predict the diagnosis for the patients. The ultimate goal is to support the development of
flexible diagnostic tools that can be particularly helpful in areas where access to conventional
bone health evaluations, such as DEXA scans, is restricted.
